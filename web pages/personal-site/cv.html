    <p>Tyler Getz is from Freehold, New Jersey and is currently an Interactive Multimedia (IMM) major at The College Of New Jersey (TCNJ) in his freshman year. He has two older sisters, one of which graduated from TCNJ just last year. He is not exactly sure what he wants to do for a career, but he is interested in exploring a lot of different fields within the IMM major and is open to any opportunities and experiences that may come his way!</p>
    
        <p>At TCNJ, Tyler also works in the Media Services department in the library, is apart of the Animal Benefits Club at the school, and is a weekly volunteer at Bonner, an after-school program at a public elementary school for economically disadvantaged kids in the area. He has always been passionate about working with kids since he became a camp counselor five years ago at the summer camp he used to go to. Every summer since 2015, Tyler has worked at the camp with kids as young as 5 years old, alongside other counselors around his age, and interracted with many adults such as his bosses as well as his camper's parents. He's gained a lot of experience working with people of all ages throughout this experience and hopes to carry the skills he's learned into a career and throughout the rest of his life.</p>
        
        <p>Any other free time Tyler has is spent hanging out with his friends on campus or his family at home, and often binging Netflix shows or old seasons of his all-time favorite TV show, <i>Survivor</i>. He has seen nearly all 40 seasons of the show since he started watching it in middle school, and hopes that one day if the circumstances are right for him, he could have the chance to be on the show himself and have the experience of a lifetime!
