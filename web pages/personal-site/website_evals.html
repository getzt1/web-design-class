    <h1>Wesbsites I Like:</h1>
    
    <h4><ul> <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">Apple:</a></h4> The website for Apple products is extremely well designed in my opinion, as it is easy to navigate and shows off all of its products effectively, while also looking really nice. On the home screen, you can scroll through and find all of their most popular products, including the latest iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and AirPods. Each product has a really cool animated graphic to go along with it that shows some of the uses of each product or how to use them. The home screen is also colorful and has easy to read text above each product, and this is all just the home screen. There is a tab on the top of the screen which allows you to click on different products/find out more easily, and each of these lead to other well designed locations within the site. </li>
    <h4><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon:</a></h4> Amazon's website is very well designed for what it is used for. Normally, a cluttered/crowded website would bother me, but for Amazon's purposes I think it is necessary and is helpful to the user to have so many places to click and navigate through the site. The main page for the site is full of relevant gift-giving and shopping ideas depending on the time of year, as well as dozens of categories for all types of things that the user may be looking to shop for and different categories for all ages. The top of the screen has a search bar, followed by a bunch of tabs below it to lead the user to some of the most popular/relevant categories and services that they may be looking for. Although the site has a lot going on and can be described as cluttered, the way it is set up does not particularly bother me as much as other sites do and I also think that the mass amount of options available to click on and navigate to is necessary and useful to the user given Amazon's uses.
    <h4><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube:</a></h4> I also really like the design of the website for YouTube. The home page gives you different sections of categories of videos for you to watch, including recommended videos, popular or relevant videos, etc. On the side, it has a bar that lets you easily access videos for channels you've chosen to subscribe to, trending videos, your history of watched videos, and a bunch of different categories of videos to search through. I like the way they have these features to make the website easy to navigate and find what you are looking for or new videos that may interest you. Other appealing features of the site include the texts used, the color schemes (including a dark mode option which I always love), as well as the spacing/setup of any text/videos/categories throughout the site.</li></ul>
    
    <h1>Wesbsites I Don't Like:</h1>
    <h4><ul> <li><a href="">Paws:</a></h4> I don't like the way that the website for Paws is organized or designed. Not only is it pretty poorly designed and boring looking, but it's also difficult to navigate and not very organized. The main page is somewhat hard to look at because it's mostly very small text and a small logo surrounded by a completely white screen. The fact that the background is white alone bothers me because I prefer looking at a darker colored screen. Not only is it white, but the white takes up most of the screen and hurts my eyes after awhile. 
    
    <h4><ul> <li><a href="https://cnj.craigslist.org">Craigslist:</a></h4> As I was researching for poorly designed web/sites I found this on one of the lists, and after looking at it for the first time I definitely agree that it needs a lot of work. It's a very popular site so I was shocked to see that it has a very basic and boring design. Similar to Paws, it is an all white background and has a bunch of blue links leading you to different places all over the screen. It is not only very messy and unorganized, but hard to look at.
    
    <h4><ul> <li><a href="http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com">Suzanne Collins' Website:</a></h4> I had no other ideas in mind for websites I do not like the design of, so I began typing in famous people and author's names in to see what their personal websites look like for their business. Author Suzanne Collins is the first one I found that I would want to fix. The layout of the images on the screen bothers me and I'm not a fan of the spacing of the text below them or the title on the top of the site. Other than a few minor things, the website is pretty decent overall though.
